                The Automated Weather Station (AWS) Project of the Ateneo de Davao University aims to contribute in increasing of adaptive capacities of communities. This can be done through data collection and analysis of data for future forecasting and modelling.
                The long term over-all objective of the research is to create models and forecasts on climate patterns and changes of the city and its nearby communities which can be used as management tools in the future in terms of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation.
                The data that will be collected from the study could be used for risk management and planning tools for watershed management and can be basis for future payment for environmental services proposals.

Topographical description of the city was also taken into account in the identification of the meteorological stationsâ€™ locations. Topography pertains to the arrangement of the natural and physical features of an area. According to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards, the location should be as flat as possible with minimum obstruction so as not to impede ventilation at the site. Areas of homogeneity, non-homogeneity and areas of transition were roughly estimated using geographical information system (GIS) tools alongside with the identification of the watersheds and elevations of the city.</v-col>

These community partners may be a local government unit (LGU), non-government organizations (NGOs), colleges and universities, privately owned land or industries. A well-founded ground support plays as crucial part in the operation of the system in the long run; therefore the commitment of a community partner is imperative.</v-col>
